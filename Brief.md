## 1. **Overview & App Concept**

- **Purpose:**  
  The app displays jokes fetched from multiple external APIs on interactive “Tinder-style” cards. Users can swipe right on a joke they like (which saves it locally as a favorite) or swipe left to skip it. No backend is required—favorites are stored on the device.

- **User Experience:**  
  The interface should feel casual and friendly, mimicking a real-life conversation or playful challenge rather than a formal competition. The overall design should be clean and intuitive, with emphasis on smooth swipe gestures and clear visual feedback.

## 5. **Data & Storage Considerations**

- **Joke Model:**  
  - Each joke should be represented by a simple model containing fields such as a unique identifier, joke text, and optionally the source or timestamp.
  
- **Local Storage:**  
  - Utilize local database solutions (like Hive or Sqflite) to store favorites.
  - Ensure that data operations (add/delete) are quick and provide immediate UI feedback.

## 6. **Design & User Interface**

- **Visual Style:**  
  - Friendly, clean, and modern with a touch of playful elements.
  - Consistent typography and color scheme that highlights readability.
  - Use of subtle animations to enhance the swipe experience.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  - Ensure the layout works well on different device sizes.
  - Touch-friendly controls and sufficient spacing for swiping.

- **Accessibility:**  
  - High-contrast text and accessible font sizes.
  - Consider gesture alternatives for users with mobility issues.

## 7. **Error Handling & Edge Cases**

- **API Failures:**  
  - Provide a graceful fallback message or retry option if jokes cannot be fetched.
  - Consider caching the last successfully fetched jokes to reduce waiting times.

- **Local Storage Errors:**  
  - Ensure that saving or deleting favorites handles errors gracefully.
  - Notify users with simple, non-intrusive messages if an error occurs.

- **Empty States:**  
  - For the Favorites page, display a friendly message or illustration when no favorites exist.
  - For the Home Page, show a loading indicator or “no jokes available” message if applicable.

## 8. **Testing & Quality Assurance**

- **User Testing:**  
  - Conduct usability tests to ensure the swipe gestures are responsive and intuitive.
  - Gather feedback on the design and flow from potential users.

- **Functional Testing:**  
  - Verify API integration works across different network conditions.
  - Test local storage operations (adding, retrieving, deleting favorites).

- **UI/UX Testing:**  
  - Ensure animations are smooth and transitions between pages are seamless.
  - Check for responsiveness across different devices and orientations.
